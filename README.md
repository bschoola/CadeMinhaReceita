# Recipe Search using ChatGPT

## How it Works

The project utilizes the power of ChatGPT, a language model developed by OpenAI, to understand your recipe queries and provide relevant responses. Here's how you can use it:

### Input Your Query
Simply type in your recipe query in natural language. For example, you could type "How to make spaghetti carbonara?" or "What ingredients do I need for chicken tikka masala?".

### Receive Response
ChatGPT will process your query and generate a response with the recipe details. You'll receive the recipe steps, ingredients, and any additional tips or variations.
